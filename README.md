In our collaborative project, Mehmet Uğur Karadağ led as the project manager and full-stack developer. He was responsible for the comprehensive development and management of the project. My contribution was more focused, aiding in specific areas like design and user interface, to complement Mehmet Uğur Karadağ's broader development responsibilities.

This project involved creating an automation system to notify users when to reorder items, such as parts for various projects. It introduced basic automation concepts and involved simple web development tools.

My role in this project was focused on designing the user interface, ensuring it was user-friendly I used a no-coding, drag-and-drop approach for front-end development.
